        <h2>Who are We?</h2>
        <p>
            We believe there is hidden power in the collective voices of Muslim women. There is a profound African proverb â€” that until the lions learn to tell their stories, every story will always glorify the hunter. Our internal conflicts are very much our own narratives and we have the luxury to express them. We are here to give the lionesses of our generation a platform to roar.
